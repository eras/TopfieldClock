Tried good while to make sense of the data, as I happen to have the same panel, and things just seemed wrong. Couldn’t get anything similar from my panel, until I figured out he probably didn’t realise it’s async serial stream, and he has also accounted delays between bytes as data…

…0 8bits nx1…0 8bits nx1…0 8bits nx1…

    Actually now that I revised the project (after a year) that idea did come across to my mind, but it worked for me, doesn’t matter :).

    I hope the decodings are useful to use nevertheles. I cannot anymore capture them from the device Topfield main board as I don’t have it anymore.

        Yes, thanks for the dump. I managed to figure out the clock function.

        Sending bytes least significant bit first: 0×02, 0×15, 0xcf, 0x0c, HH, MM, SS, 0×03
